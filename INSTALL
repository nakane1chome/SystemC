  gmake         http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html


Basic SystemC Installation
==========================

To install SystemC on a UNIX system, do the following steps:

  1. Change to the top level directory (systemc-2.1)

  2. Create a temporary directory, e.g.,

        > mkdir objdir

  3. Change to the temporary directory, e.g.,

        > cd objdir

  4. Set the following environment variable(s):

     For gcc compilers on Solaris:

        > setenv CXX g++

     For Forte 8 on Solaris:

        > setenv CXX CC

     For gcc compilers on Linux:

        > setenv CXX g++

     For gcc compilers on MacOS X:

        > setenv CXX g++

     For aCC on HP-UX:

        > setenv CXX aCC

     You can also specify an absolute path to the compiler of your choice.

  5. Configure the package for your system, e.g.,
     (The configure script is explained below.)

        > ../configure

     While the 'configure' script is running, which takes a few moments, 
     it prints messages to inform you of the features it is checking.
     It also detects the platform.
     
     Note for System V users: 
     If you are using `csh' on an older version of System V, you might 
     need to use the `sh ../configure' command instead of '../configure'.
     Otherwise, `csh' will attempt to `configure' itself.

     SystemC 2.1 includes a fixed-point package that is always built.
     When compiling your applications with fixed-point types, you still have
     to use compiler flag -DSC_INCLUDE_FX. Note that compile times increase
     significantly when using this compiler flag.

     In case you want to install the package in another place than the
     top level directory (systemc-2.1), configure the package e.g. as
     follows:

        > ../configure --prefix=/usr/local/systemc-2.1

     Note: make sure you have created the target directory before installing
           the package. Do _not_ use /usr/local as a prefix.

  6. Compile the package.

     For an optimized SystemC library, enter:

        > gmake

     For a debug SystemC library, enter:

        > gmake debug

  7. Install the package.

        > gmake install
  
  8. At this point you may wish to verify the installation by 
     testing the example suite.

        > gmake check

     this will compile and run the examples in the subdirectory
     examples.

  9. You can now remove the temporary directory, .e.g,

        > cd ..
        > rm -rf objdir

     Alternatively, you can keep the temporary directory to allow
     you to:

     a) Experiment with the examples.

     b) Later uninstall the package. To clean up the temporary 
        directory, enter:

            > gmake clean

        To uninstall the package, enter:

            > gmake uninstall


Running the Examples
====================

A copy of the examples reside in the temporary directory - see 
instruction 8 above for details on building and running them. 

In addition, a copy of the example code resides in the directory
examples at the highest level of the installation.

Use the makefiles provided in  the 'examples' directory as templates 
for makefiles you need for compiling your own examples.
        
     
Using the Configure Script
==========================
 
The `configure' shell script tries to determine the correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation. It uses
these values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
It also creates one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
definitions if needed. Then, it creates the following files:

  config.status         A shell script that you can run at another time to
                        recreate the current configuration.

  config.cache          A file in which the configure test results are
                        saved to speed up reconfiguration.

                        Data is appended to the config.cache file. 
                        You can remove unwanted data.

  config.log            A file in which compiler output is saved.
                        This is used to debug the configure script.

If you need to use other commands to successfully compile the package
on your system, please try to determine if the configure script can be used 
for these commands. Then, send either a diff file or instructions about
the commands you used to the email address provided in the README file.
This information will be used to improve the installation process in
the next release.

The `configure.in' file is provided in case you want to change or regenerate
the `configure' script, for example to use a newer version of `autoconf'. 
The `configure.in' file is used by the `autoconf' program to create the
`configure' script.

Note for (key) developers:

  In case you have changed the `configure.in' file or one of the
  `Makefile.am' files:

  - Use the `config/distclean' script to remove the generated `configure'
    script, the generated `aclocal.m4' file and the generated `Makefile.am'
    files.

  - Use the `config/bootstrap' script to generate the `configure' script
    and the necessary `Makefile.in' files. This script makes use of the
    GNU auto-tools `aclocal', `automake', and `autoconf'.


Compilation and Linking Options
===============================

Some systems require compilation or linking options that the `configure'
script does not define. You can define the initial values for these
options by setting them in your environment before running the
`configure' script.

Using a Bourne-compatible shell, the command line entry might be:

        > CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ../configure

Or, on systems that have the `env' program, the command line entry might be:

        > env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ../configure


Optional Features
=================

To build optimized libraries (default), from the top level directory run:

        > gmake opt

To build libraries with debug information, from the top level directory run:

        > gmake debug

followed by gmake, and gmake install.

e.g. the following command will rebuild the optimized library from scratch:

        > gmake clean opt install

By default, optimized libraries are built.


Specifying the System Type
==========================

Some features cannot be automatically determined by `configure' unless
it can detect the host type on which the package will run.
If it prints a message that it cannot determine the host type, 
use the `--host=TYPE' option to define it. TYPE can either be a 
short system name, such as `sun4', or a canonical name with three fields:

     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM

See the `config.sub' file for details about the values of each field. If
the `config.sub' file is not included in the package, the package does not
need to know the host type.

If you are building compiler tools for cross-compiling, you can also
use the `--target=TYPE' option to select the type of system for which
the code is produced and the `--build=TYPE' option to select the type of
system on which you are compiling the package.


Sharing Defaults
================

You can set the default values that `configure' scripts share by
creating a site shell script called `config.site'. This file contains the
default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
The `configure' script looks for the `config.site' file in the following 
search precedence:

  1. PREFIX/share/config.site

  2. PREFIX/etc/config.site

Alternatively, you can set the `CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the
site script path.

Note: The `configure' script for some systems does not look for a site script.


Operation Controls
==================

The `configure' script recognizes the following options to control its
operation:

`--cache-file=FILE'
        Use and save the test results in FILE instead of
        `./config.cache'. Set FILE to `/dev/null' to disable caching
        when debugging `configure'.

`--help'
        Print a summary of `configure' options and exit.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
        Do not print messages about checks being made.
        To suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null'.
        Error messages continue to print.

`--srcdir=DIR'
        Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.
        Typically `configure' determines the directory automatically.

`--version'
        Print the version of `autoconf' used to generate the `configure'
        script and exit.

Other options that are rarely used are available in the `configure' script.
Use the `--help' option to print a list.



2. Installation Notes for Windows
---------------------------------

This release has been ported to Windows 2000/ Windows XP and Visual C++ 
versions 6.0 and 7.1.

The SystemC distribution may be downloaded from the SystemC web site and
includes project and workspace files for Visual C++. You can use these 
project and workspace files to build the SystemC library and a set of 
example applications. Extract the download to an appropriate directory
on your PC, this should create a top-level directory named 'systemc-2.1'.

Visual C++ 6.0
--------------
The download directory contains two subdirectories: 'msvc60' and
'examples'.

The 'msvc60' directory contains the project and workspace files to
compile the 'systemc.lib' library. Double-click on the 'systemc.dsw'
file to launch Visual C++ 6.0 with the workspace file. The workspace file
will have the proper switches set to compile for Visual C++ 6.0.
Select `Build systemc.lib' under the Build menu or press F7 to build
'systemc.lib'.

The 'examples' directory contains the project and workspace files to
compile the SystemC examples. Go to one of the examples subdirectories
and double-click on the .dsw file to launch Visual C++ with the
workspace file. The workspace file will have the proper switches set
to compile for Visual C++ 6.0. Select 'Build <example>.exe' under the
Build menu or press F7 to build the example executable.

To create a new design, first create a new project by using the 'New'
menu item under the 'File' menu. Select the Projects tab on the dialog
box that appears and select a Win32 Console Application. Create an
empty project.

For your own SystemC applications, make sure that the Run Time Type
Information switch is on by using the 'Settings...' menu item under
the 'Project' menu. Select the C/C++ tab, and select the 'C++
Language' category. Make sure that the 'Enable Run Time Type
Information (RTTI)' checkbox is checked. The systemc library needs to
be included during linking. Select the 'Link' tab from the 'Project' ->
'Settings' menu. Add 'systemc.lib' to the end of the list of libraries
in the 'Object/library modules:' box.

Also make sure that the compiler and linker can find the SystemC header 
and library files respectively. There are two ways to do this:

To update the include file and library directory search paths for all
projects:

  Select Tools -> Options menu and the Directories tab
   
  Select show directories for: Library files

  Select the 'New' icon and browse to: ...\systemc-2.1\msvc60\systemc\debug

  Select show directories for: Include files

  Select the 'New' icon and browse to: ...\systemc-2.1\src

To add the include file and library directory search paths for the current
project only:

  Select Project -> Settings menu and the C/C++ tab. 
  
  Select the 'Preprocessor' category and type the path to the SystemC 'src' 
  directory in the text entry field labeled
  'Additional include directories' (e.g. the examples use '../../../src').

  Select the Link tab.
  
  Select the 'Input' category and type the path to the SystemC library: 
  ...\systemc-2.1\msvc60\systemc\debug
  

Next add the source files to the project by using the `Add To
Project>Files...' menu item under the `Project' menu. Make sure that
the files are added to the new project directory just created. 


Visual C++ 7.1
--------------
The download directory contains two subdirectories: 'msvc71' and
'examples'.

The 'msvc71' directory contains the project and workspace files to
compile the 'systemc.lib' library. Double-click on the 'SystemC.vcproj'
file to launch Visual C++ 7.1 with the workspace file. The workspace file
will have the proper switches set to compile for Visual C++ 7.1.
Select `Build SystemC' under the Build menu or press F7 to build
`systemc.lib'.

The `examples' directory contains the project and workspace files to
compile the SystemC examples. Go to one of the examples subdirectories
and double-click on the .vcproj file to launch Visual C++ with the
workspace file. The workspace file will have the proper switches set
to compile for Visual C++ 7.1. Select 'Build <example>.exe' under the
Build menu or press F7 to build the example executable.
