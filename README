		SystemC Class Library (Rel. 2.0)
                ================================

This is the production release of the SystemC 2.0 Class Library.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
				IMPORTANT

1. This is the production release of SystemC 2.0. This release
   contains all functionality of SystemC 1.0.2, and the new SystemC
   2.0 core language features. It does not contain methodology-specific
   channels, as were available in SystemC 1.2.1 beta.

2. This release is supported on the following platforms for which it has
   been well tested:
    o Sun Solaris 2.7 and 2.8 with GNU C++ compiler version 2.95.2
    o Sun Solaris 2.7 and 2.8 with SC6.1 and SC6.2
    o Linux (Redhat 6.2) with GNU C++ compiler version 2.95.2
    o HP-UX 11.00 with aCC C++ compiler versions A.03.31 and A.03.15
      (Note: +O1 is the highest safe optimization level)
    o Windows NT 4.0 (SP3 and higher) with VC++ 6.0

3. From this release onwards, the SystemC 2.0 core language features
   (as defined in the 2.0 Functional Specification) will be released
   separately from the methodology-specific libraries, like the 
   Master-Slave library. This is being done to ensure that core language
   developers and library developers can work independently to bring the
   latest features to the user community, without having to depend on one
   another. This will allow features and bug fixes to appear quicker. 

   As a result of this separation, all methodology-specific libraries 
   have to be downloaded separately. You will receive separate tar files
   for the core language and the methodology-specific libraries. You will
   have to untar them and build them separately. However, you can install
   the core language and the the methodology-specific libraries in one
   location so that all users at your site can have access to an 
   integrated SystemC library. Please see the INSTALL file of the 
   methodology-specific library for details on how to do this.

   The methodology-specific Master-Slave Library will be available
   shortly from the SystemC website.

4. From this release onwards, SystemC releases will not include
   precompiled libraries anymore. For instructions on how to build
   and install the SystemC library, see the separate INSTALL file.
   As an exception, the separate Windows release of SystemC will
   still include a precompiled library.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This release does not support SystemC 0.9 specific features anymore.
In addition, the directory structure has changed and the build process
has been improved.
