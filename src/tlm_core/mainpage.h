* About SystemC TLM
* 
* Transaction-level Modeling (TLM) standard interfaces for SystemC
* provides an essential framework needed for model exchange within
* companies and across the IP supply chain for architecture analysis,
* software development and performance analysis, and hardware
* verification. It explicitly addresses virtual prototyping in which
* SystemC models can easily be exchanged and arranged within a
* system. By providing a strong modeling foundation for virtual
* prototyping, the standard enables optimal reuse of models and modeling
* effort across different use cases.
