 *
* SystemC® addresses the need for a system design and verification
* language that spans hardware and software. It is a language built in
* standard C++ by extending the language with the use of class
* libraries. The language is particularly suited to model system's
* partitioning, to evaluate and verify the assignment of blocks to
* either hardware or software implementations, and to architect and
* measure the interactions between and among functional blocks. Leading
* companies in the intellectual property (IP), electronic design
* automation (EDA), semiconductor, electronic systems, and embedded
* software industries currently use SystemC for architectural
* exploration, to deliver high-performance hardware blocks at various
* levels of abstraction and to develop virtual platforms for
* hardware/software co-design. SystemC was defined by the Open SystemC
* Initiative (OSCI) and ratified as IEEE Std. 1666™-2011.
