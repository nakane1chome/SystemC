               Release Notes for SystemC Release 1.0.2

This release fixes signal update bug present in 1.0.1:

bug #114640: a signal gets updated whenever a write is performed 
even if the value did not change.

               Release Notes for SystemC Release 1.0

1. ISDB tracing is supported, but if you want to use ISDB, you need
   libisdb.a. THIS LIBRARY IS NOT DISPTRIBUTED WITH SystemC.

2. Copying is governed under the terms of the license agreement. Please 
   see the LICENSE file.

3. Documentation for the QuickThreads library is not included with
   this release. QuickThreads is distributed as a pre-built library.

4. Initial values of signals.  Signals of built-in types and plain structs 
   have unspecified initial values.  Only signals of resolved types
   have "known" initial values, i.e. 'X'.  Therefore, in order to make
   simulation deterministic, note the following:

    1) Initialize all nonresolved signals before simulation begins.
       This can be done with the operator = or the write() method:

        sc_signal<bool> x, y;
        // ...
        x = 0;
        y.write(1);
        // ...
        sc_start(100);

    2) Do not initialize or write to a resolved signal outside of a 
       process.  This will cause undesired behavior.

        sc_signal_resolved r;
        // ...
        r = '1';  // WRONG! -- not inside a process
        // ...
        sc_start(100);


Platforms Supported:
-------------------

SystemC can be installed on the following platforms

1) Sun Solaris with GNU C++ compiler version GCC-2.95.2.

         GCC and gmake are free software and can be obtained
         from the following sources. 
         
	GCC can be obtained from 
                 http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html 
         gmake can be obtained from
                 http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html 
         
2) Linux with GNU C++ compiler version GCC-2.95.2.

         See item 1 above for sources of compilers for this platform.



3) Sun Solaris with SC5.0 C++ compiler. For installation, see INSTALL file; 
         other compiler specific issues, see README file.



Note: SystemC v.1.0 CANNOT be compiled with GNU C++ compilers prior to
version 2.95.2. Type gcc --version to see the version of compiler you're using.
